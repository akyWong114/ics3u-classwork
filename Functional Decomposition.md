#  Functional Decomposition

##  Vending machince from a machine perspective
  - Wait until coins are inserted into my key slot
    - Calculate the value of coins recieved and display
    - Turn on key-pad lights to indicate money has been calculated
  - Wait for human to click the code for the desired flavour on the key pad and press enter
    - Compare the price associated with code and money obtained
      - If difference is 0 the bag of chips will be dropped down into accessible box
      - If there's a remaining amount provide the same value of change into change bin
      - Otherwise the bag of chips will not be dropped down and key will display invalid
  - If change button is pressed before purchasing any items
      - All the inserted amount will be released into the change bin
  
  
##Exploring the BASIC commands used
  - Conditional Branching: "If ... do..., else ... do..." statement. Certain conditions trigger another action to occur.
  - Loop: Repetition of a sequence of processes.
  - Nested Structure: Statements within another statement.
  
##  The cookie is too big for the glass
1. How to fix this problem
  - Take cookie out of the jar and break it into half. 
  - Place the halves into the jar
2. How to prevent this problem
  - Make cookies with a smaller diameter to fit the jar
3. How can this problem be solved with an app
  - Measurement app
    - App scans diameter of the cookie and the jar
    - If the diameter of the cookie is less than that of the jar the app will produce a chime sound, 
      otherwise the app will show the words too big
     
##  People who can't park
1. How to fix this problem
  - Call a towing company to report the car
  - Towing company will take the car away
2. How can you prevent this problem
  - Place concrete blocks to act as the parking lines/dividers between parking spots
3. How can this problem be solved with a robotic and/or software solution
  - The car itself will have a sensor/scanner that senses whether or not the car is parked properly.
    - If car is not parked properly a beeping sound will ring out and the car will not be allowed to switch to a parking stance
      until parked properly
